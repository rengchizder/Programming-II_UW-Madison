# P09 Dictionary using Binary Search Trees (BST)

## Project Overview
The Dictionary project involves implementing a dictionary using Binary Search Trees (BST). The dictionary stores a collection of words and their meanings, allowing for efficient addition and retrieval of word definitions. This project emphasizes the use of BSTs for managing ordered data.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Modeled the dictionary system using classes.
- **Data Structures**: Implemented a dictionary using BSTs.
- **Algorithm Design**: Designed and implemented BST operations.
- **Data Management**: Efficiently stored and retrieved word definitions.
- **Problem Solving**: Applied BSTs to manage a collection of ordered elements.

## Files Included
