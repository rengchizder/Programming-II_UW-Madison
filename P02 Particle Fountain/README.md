# Particle Fountain - CS300: Programming II - UW Madison
## Overview
This project is a simulation of a particle fountain developed for the CS300: Programming II course at UW Madison. The simulation involves creating and animating particles that move in a fountain-like pattern on the screen.

## Key Features
- **Particle Animation:** Simulate particles moving in a realistic fountain pattern.
- **GUI Interaction:** User can interact with the simulation through a graphical user interface.
- **Customizable Settings:** Various settings such as particle speed and fountain size can be customized.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Object-oriented programming in Java
- Working with graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
- Handling animations and real-time updates
- Implementing procedural programming concepts
- Test-driven development for reliable and maintainable code
