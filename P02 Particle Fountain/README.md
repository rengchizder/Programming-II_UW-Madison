# P02 Particle Fountain

## Project Overview
The Particle Fountain project involves creating a graphical simulation of a particle fountain. This project builds on the OOP principles by introducing inheritance and polymorphism to design particles with different behaviors. The project also incorporates graphical user interface (GUI) development and animation, providing a visual and interactive element to the application.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Utilized inheritance and polymorphism to design various particle types.
- **GUI Development**: Used Java Swing for graphical representation.
- **Animation**: Managed particle movement and behavior over time.
- **Event Handling**: Implemented event-driven programming for user interactions.

## Files Included
