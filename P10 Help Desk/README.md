# P10 Priority Queue using Heap Data Structure

## Project Overview
The Priority Queue project involves developing a system to prioritize support tickets for a help desk using a heap data structure. After implementing the priority queue, several tests are developed to demonstrate the correctness of the implementation. This project highlights the use of heaps for efficient data management and prioritization.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Modeled the priority queue system using classes.
- **Data Structures**: Implemented a priority queue using heaps.
- **Algorithm Design**: Designed and implemented heap operations.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Developed tests to ensure the correctness of the implementation.
- **Problem Solving**: Applied heaps to manage and prioritize support
