# P08 Queue Implementation and Dinner Party Problems

## Project Overview
The Queue Implementation project involves developing a queue using an array with circular indexing. Once the queue is implemented, it is used to solve three different problems related to peculiar seating and serving arrangements at a friend's monthly dinner parties. This project focuses on data structure implementation and application.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Implemented a queue class with required methods.
- **Data Structures**: Implemented a queue with circular indexing.
- **Algorithm Design**: Developed solutions for real-world problems using the queue.
- **Problem Solving**: Applied data structures to solve specific problems.
- **Efficiency**: Ensured efficient use of arrays for queue operations.
