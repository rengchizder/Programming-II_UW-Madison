# P06 Storage Unit Organizer

## Project Overview
The Storage Unit Organizer project involves creating a program to manage and organize a storage unit. This project emphasizes the use of advanced data structures like hash tables or binary search trees for efficient data management. The system supports adding, removing, and finding items within the storage unit, building on previous projects' concepts.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Modeled the storage unit and its operations using classes.
- **Data Structures**: Implemented hash tables or binary search trees for data management.
- **Algorithm Design**: Designed and implemented algorithms for organizing and managing items.
- **Efficiency**: Focused on efficient data storage and retrieval techniques.
